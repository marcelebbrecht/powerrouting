PowerRouting for OMNeT++ - ToDo
===============================

Version: 0.4 - in progress
--------------------------

* lower time, raise power consumption for shorter simulations
* Test OLSR Router, raise timelimits and set routing options
* Error with MAC Interface down / Optimize parameters
* Create OLSRPO Router and Routing and test
  * Use Energy to lower willingness
  * contraints min/max for parameters
  * maybe send RERR-like message -> Readme
* Compare OLSR <-> AODV
* Merge, Switch to master and delete branch
* Test, test, test
* Install & Sync on Notebook

* Mail and ask
  * Make not runnable Config not runnable
  * Maybe Batman? -> version 0.5


Finalize
--------

* Prepare Thesis
	* Own GitHub project powerrouting-thesis
	* Readme -> Reference


Future
------

* Maybe Batman
* OLSR and PO by inheritance
* More runs with different parameter values and statistics
* More hosts sending packets (Parameter?)
* Dynamic senders and receivers
* Sense for longterm tests
