Version: 0.2 - work in progress

First try with OLSR and maybe, B.A.T.M.A.N.
- translated to english - 2017-06-26
- ported to inetmanet 3.5 - 2017-06-26
- created own aodvpo dirs in node and routing - 2017-06-26
- recreated run configurations - 2017-06-27
- configured net-diameter for aodvpo as 128 for working with higher hop counts - 2017-06-27  
- created olsr and barman directories in node an appropriate node ned files - 2017-06-27
- first simple oslr and batman networks created and tested successfully - 2017-06-27
- batman seems awfull, removed for version 0.2, maybe in version 0.3 - 2017-06-27
- created OLSRPO ned under routing/extras/olsrpo - 2017-06-27
- created OLSRPORouter ned under node/olsrpo and node - 2017-06-27
- created complete configs/neds and so, whole testbed for OLSR - 2017-06-27
- Hallo-Interval for OLSR set to 5s - 2017-06-27
